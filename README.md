## How Your System Works

### **1. Data Collection**

#### **Tasks** (from `/routes/tasks.js`)
- Students create tasks with:
  - Title, type (exam/project/assignment/quiz)
  - Deadline, estimated effort (hours)
  - Completion status

#### **Grades** (from `/routes/grades.js`)
- Students add grades with:
  - Subject, exam type
  - Marks, max marks, percentage
  - Date, semester

#### **Calendar Events** (from `/routes/calendar.js`)
- **Institutional Events** (created by Admin):
  - Student Tour, Welfare Visit, Course Wish List, etc.
  - Visible to ALL students
  - Have: title, eventType, startDate, endDate, priority, venue
  
- **Personal Events** (created by Students):
  - Private to each student
  - Same structure as institutional

### **2. Workload Calculation** (from `/services/workload.js`)

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
calculateWorkloadScores(studentId, startDate, endDate) {
  // 1. Fetch tasks in date range
  const tasks = await Task.find({ studentId, deadline: {...} });
  
  // 2. Group by day
  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const weight = WEIGHTS[task.type];  // exam=3, project=2.5, etc.
    const weightedEffort = task.estimatedEffort * weight;
    dailyScores[date] += weightedEffort;
  });
  
  // 3. Save to WorkloadScore collection
  // 4. Calculate weekly aggregates
}
```

** Weights:**
- Exam: 3x
- Project: 2.5x
- Assignment: 1.5x
- Quiz: 1x

### **3. Burnout Prediction** (from `/services/burnout.js`)

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
predictBurnout(studentId) {
  // Run 4 detectors in parallel
  [collision, volatility, recovery, drift] = await Promise.all([
    detectCollisions(studentId),      // Check upcoming deadline overload
    detectVolatility(studentId),       // Check workload spikes
    analyzeRecoveryGap(studentId),     // Check continuous work without rest
    analyzePerformanceDrift(studentId) // Check grades vs effort trend
  ]);
  
  // Calculate score (0-100)
  score = 0;
  if (collision.hasCollision) score += 30;
  if (volatility.hasVolatility) score += 15-25;
  if (recovery.hasRecoveryDeficit) score += 25;
  if (drift.hasDrift) score += 10-20;
  
  // Determine risk level
  if (score >= 60) risk = 'high';
  else if (score >= 30) risk = 'medium';
  else risk = 'low';
  
  // Save to Signal collection
}
```

### **4. Signal Detectors**

#### **Collision Detector** (`/services/collision.js`)
- Gets tasks from next 14 days
- Groups by week
- Checks if:
  - ≥3 major tasks (exam/project) in one week, OR
  - Total hours >50 in one week
- ** PROBLEM:** Only checks TASKS, not EVENTS

#### **Volatility Detector** (`/services/volatility.js`)
- Gets last 4 weeks workload
- Compares current week vs previous week
- Flags if increase ≥50%
- ** PROBLEM:** Workload only from TASKS

#### **Recovery Detector** (`/services/recovery.js`)
- Gets last 30 days workload
- Finds continuous high-load days (score >10)
- Flags if ≥7 days without rest
- ** PROBLEM:** Workload only from TASKS

#### **Drift Detector** (`/services/drift.js`)
- Gets 6 months of grades and workload
- Checks if effort increasing but grades declining
- Flags sustained drift (≥3 months)
- ** PROBLEM:** Workload only from TASKS

##  Data Flow Analysis

### **Current Flow (INCOMPLETE)**

```
Student adds Task
    ↓
Task saved to MongoDB
    ↓
calculateWorkloadScores() reads ONLY tasks
    ↓
WorkloadScore collection updated
    ↓
predictBurnout() runs detectors
    ↓
Detectors read WorkloadScore (incomplete data)
    ↓
Signal saved with INACCURATE burnout score
    ↓
Student dashboard shows WRONG risk level
```

### **What Happens to Calendar Events?**

```
Admin uploads institutional events
    ↓
CalendarEvent.create({ isInstitutional: true })
    ↓
Saved to MongoDB
    ↓
/calendar/all route returns events
    ↓
calendar.html displays them 
    ↓
BUT... they are NEVER read by workload calculation ❌
    ↓
burnout prediction ignores them ❌
    ↓
student.html doesn't show them ❌
```

##  The Problem Identified

### **Issue #1: Calendar Events NOT in Workload Calculation**

**File:** `/services/workload.js`
**Function:** `calculateWorkloadScores()`

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const tasks = await Task.find({
  studentId,
  deadline: { $gte: startDate, $lte: endDate }
});
// ❌ Calendar events are NEVER fetched
```

**Impact:**
- Student has 5 upcoming events → Workload shows 0
- Burnout score = LOW (incorrect)
- Charts are empty or misleading

### **Issue #2: Collision Detector Ignores Events**

**File:** `/services/collision.js`
**Function:** `detectCollisions()`

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const tasks = await Task.find({
  studentId,
  deadline: { $gte: today, $lte: twoWeeksLater }
});
// ❌ Doesn't count Student Tour, Welfare Visit, etc.
```

**Impact:**
- Student has 3 exams + 2 events in one week
- System sees only 3 items → No collision warning
- Should trigger collision (≥3 major items)

### **Issue #3: Student Dashboard Missing Events**

**File:** `/frontend/pages/student.html`
**Current Code:**
```javascript
// Only loads:
await loadBurnoutAnalysis();
await loadWorkloadChart();
await loadUpcomingTasks();
await loadRecentGrades();

// ❌ No function to load calendar events
```

**Impact:**
- Events exist in database
- calendar.html shows them
- student.html doesn't display them

---

## Solution Architecture

### **Phase 1: Backend Fixes**

#### **1.1 Update Workload Service**
**File:** `/services/workload.js`

**Changes:**
- Fetch both tasks AND calendar events
- Calculate event workload with proper weights
- Combine task + event scores

**Event Weights:**
```javascript
exam: 8       // High stress (equivalent to 2 exam tasks)
registration: 4  // Moderate effort
event: 3      // General attendance
holiday: 0    // Rest day
```

#### **1.2 Update Collision Detector**
**File:** `/services/collision.js`

**Changes:**
- Fetch calendar events alongside tasks
- Count institutional events as major items
- Include in collision check

#### **1.3 Update Burnout Service**
**File:** `/services/burnout.js`

**Changes:**
- Pass event data to all detectors
- Include events in reasons array
- Update signal schema if needed

### **Phase 2: Frontend Fixes**

#### **2.1 Update API Client**
**File:** `/frontend/js/api.js`

**Status:** ✅ Already correct
```javascript
calendarAPI.get(startDate, endDate) {
  return apiCall(`/calendar/all?startDate=${...}&endDate=${...}`);
}
```

#### **2.2 Update Student Dashboard**
**File:** `/frontend/pages/student.html`

**Changes:**
- Add `loadUpcomingEvents()` function
- Display events with proper styling
- Auto-refresh when returning to page

### **Phase 3: Data Model Updates**

#### **3.1 CalendarEvent Model**
**File:** `/models/CalendarEvent.js`

**Verify fields:**
- `eventType`: exam | registration | event | holiday
- `isInstitutional`: boolean
- `startDate`, `endDate`: Date
- `duration`: number (hours) - ADD if missing

#### **3.2 WorkloadScore Model**
**File:** `/models/WorkloadScore.js`

**Add fields:**
```javascript
{
  taskScore: Number,    // Workload from tasks only
  eventScore: Number,   // Workload from events only
  dailyScore: Number,   // Total (task + event)
  // ... existing fields
}
```

## 📝 Current vs Desired Behavior

### **Scenario: Student with Events**

**Input Data:**
- 2 Exam tasks (deadline: Feb 10)
- 1 Project task (deadline: Feb 12)
- Student Tour event (Feb 8)
- Welfare Visit event (Feb 10)
- Course Registration event (Feb 9)

#### **CURRENT BEHAVIOR ❌**

**Workload Calculation:**
```
Only counts 3 tasks:
- Daily score = Exam(3x5h) + Exam(3x4h) + Project(2.5x8h) = 47h
- Events = 0 (ignored)
- Total = 47h
```

**Collision Detection:**
```
Week of Feb 8-14:
- Major tasks: 2 (exams)
- Total hours: 47h
- Collision? NO (needs ≥3 major OR ≥50h)
```

**Burnout Score:**
```
- Collision: 0 (no collision)
- Volatility: 15 (maybe spike from last week)
- Recovery: 0 (not enough data)
- Drift: 0 (grades OK)
- TOTAL: 15 → LOW RISK ❌
```

**Student Dashboard:**
```
- Burnout Risk: LOW ✓
- Workload Chart: Shows 47h ✓
- Upcoming Tasks: Shows 3 tasks ✓
- Upcoming Events: MISSING ❌
```

#### **DESIRED BEHAVIOR ✅**

**Workload Calculation:**
```
Tasks: 47h
Events:
- Student Tour: 8 (exam-type) × 3h = 24
- Welfare Visit: 8 × 3h = 24
- Registration: 4 × 3h = 12
- Total event score = 60

Combined daily score = 107h for the week
```

**Collision Detection:**
```
Week of Feb 8-14:
- Major items: 2 exams + 2 major events = 4
- Total hours: 107h
- Collision? YES (≥3 major AND ≥50h) ✅
```

**Burnout Score:**
```
- Collision: 30 (overload detected) ✅
- Volatility: 20 (spike from 47h to 107h)
- Recovery: 0
- Drift: 0
- TOTAL: 50 → MEDIUM RISK ✅
```

**Student Dashboard:**
```
- Burnout Risk: MEDIUM ✓
- Workload Chart: Shows 107h ✓
- Upcoming Tasks: Shows 3 tasks ✓
- Upcoming Events: Shows 3 events ✅
- Alerts: "Deadline Overload Alert!" ✅
```

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### **Step 1: Check Database**
```javascript
// In MongoDB or via API
CalendarEvent.find({ isInstitutional: true })
// Should return events like Student Tour, Welfare Visit
```

### **Step 2: Check Workload API**
```bash
GET /api/workload?days=30
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# BEFORE FIX:
{
  "date": "2026-02-10",
  "dailyScore": 47,
  "taskCount": 3,
  "eventCount": 0  ❌
}

# AFTER FIX:
{
  "date": "2026-02-10",
  "dailyScore": 107,
  "taskScore": 47,
  "eventScore": 60,
  "taskCount": 3,
  "eventCount": 3  ✅
}
```

### **Step 3: Check Burnout API**
```bash
GET /api/burnout/analysis
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# BEFORE FIX:
{
  "score": 15,
  "risk": "low",
  "reasons": []
}

# AFTER FIX:
{
  "score": 50,
  "risk": "medium",
  "reasons": [
    "4 major deadlines/events in next 7 days",
    "Workload increased by 127%"
  ],
  "signals": {
    "collision": {
      "hasCollision": true,
      "count": 4,
      "tasks": 2,
      "events": 2  ✅
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 4: Check Student Dashboard**
- Refresh page
- Should see "Upcoming Events" section
- Should see higher burnout score
- Workload chart should show spikes on event days

## 📚 Key Takeaways

### **What Was Wrong:**
1. ❌ Workload calculation only counted tasks
2. ❌ Calendar events were isolated in their own feature
3. ❌ No integration between calendar and burnout system
4. ❌ Student dashboard didn't display events

### **What Needs to Happen:**
1. ✅ Fetch events alongside tasks in workload calculation
2. ✅ Assign appropriate weights to event types
3. ✅ Include events in all 4 burnout detectors
4. ✅ Display events on student dashboard
5. ✅ Combine task + event data in all analyses

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Accuracy**: Burnout prediction is only as good as the data
- **Completeness**: Missing 50% of workload = Wrong predictions
- **User Trust**: Students won't trust "LOW RISK" when they're overwhelmed
- **Proctor Effectiveness**: Can't intervene if system doesn't detect issues
